The next step in the selection of the 16 Michigan electors is the certification
of the election results by the State Canvas Board.  This board will meet on November 23rd
to receive the reports of county canvas boards from all around the state.  The
four members of this board are chair Jeannette Bradshaw (D), Vice-Chair Aaron
Van Langevelde (R) Norman D. Shinkle (R), and Julie Matuzak (D). If three or all
four members of this board vote to accept the results presented by the county
canvas boards, then the elecion is certified.  However, if fewer than
three board members vote to accept the results, then the election is not certified
and the determination of the electors is turned over to the Supreme Court of the
state of Michigan.  If that court cannot reach a determination, then the state
legislature choses the electors.

If Michigan completes all of these procedures by December 8th, the so-called
"safe harbor" date, then the state's determination of its electors is final and
may not be challenged.  If, however, it does not complete its determnation by
December 8th, then the U.S. Congress may step in and decide which electors will
represent the state in the electoral college.

The electoral college meets on December 14th, 2020.
